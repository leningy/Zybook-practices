A method that calls itself is a recursive method

A binary search algorithm begins at the midpoint of the range and halves the range after each guess. 

The recursive method has an if-else statement. The if branch ends the recursion, known as the base case.

- Every recursive method must have a case that returns a value without performing a recursive call. That case is called the base case. 
- The programmer then adds the recursive case to the method.

**Algorithms**
The Fibonacci sequence is 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, etc.; starting with 0, 1, the pattern is to compute the next number by adding the previous two numbers.
solve the greatest common divisor problem.

Each method call places a new stack frame on the stack, for local parameters, local variables, and more method items. Upon return, the frame is deleted.

Deep recursion could fill the stack region and cause a stack overflow
